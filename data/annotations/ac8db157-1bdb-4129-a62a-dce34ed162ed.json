New types of men arose mysteriously out of a whirling reality which now revealed itself to be Protean in its ability to rapidly change its appearance. Perhaps the novel answers man's fearful awareness that behind the facade of social organization, manners, customs, rituals, and institutions, which give form to what we call society, there lies only chaos. For man knows despite the certainties which his social organizations serve to give him that he did not create the universe and that the universe is not at all concerned with human institutions and values, and perhaps even what we call sanity is no more than a mutual agreement among men as to the nature of reality, a very tenuous definition of the real which allows us some certainty and stability in our dedicated task of humanizing the universe."

It was not English. We did not have the American, I mean the English institutions, and indeed, we had no need for them. And if we had need for them, we could not create them here, because we didn't have the saw, we didn't have the ships, the island. We didn't have any of those wonderful things, which made for the wonderful novels and plays and poetry. But we did have something else. We had a society dedicated to a conception of freedom, which was new and vibrant, from which the social unit was not that of class, or only class, but of national groupings. And though classes emerged, they were and are still confused and cut across by the nature of our melting pot. That is a society made up of people from many backgrounds dragging with them many cultural traditions, customs, folklore, and what not, a varied society made up of many, many peoples and so forth."
